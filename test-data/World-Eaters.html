                     Weapons with [ANTI-KEYWORD X+] in their profile are known as Anti weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon against a target with the keyword after the word &#8216;Anti-&#8217;, an unmodified Wound roll of &#8216;x+&#8217; scores a Critical Wound.

                    <span class="bold">Blast:</span>
                     Weapons with [BLAST] in their profile are known as Blast weapons, and they make a random number of attacks. Each time you determine how many attacks are made with a Blast weapon, add 1 to the result for every five models that were in the target unit when you selected it as the target (rounding down). Blast weapons can never be used to make attacks against a unit that is within Engagement Range of one or more units from the attacking model&#8217;s army (including its own unit).

                    <span class="bold">Blessings of Khorne:</span>
                     If your Army Faction is WORLD EATERS, at the start of the battle round, you can make a Blessings of Khorne roll. To do so, roll eight D6. You can then use those dice to activate up to two Blessings of Khorne from the Blessings of Khorne list. Each Blessing of Khorne specifies the dice results it requires (where a number is specified, a double or triple of that value or higher is required). You can only activate each Blessing of Khorne once per battle round. Any unused dice from the Blessings of Khorne roll are then discarded.<br/>
                    Once activated, each Blessing of Khorne applies to all units from your army with this ability until the end of the battle round.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Example: Ash makes their Blessings of Khorne roll and gets the following dice: 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6, 6. First they use the two 6s to activate Warp Blades (which requires a double 5+), leaving the following dice: 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4.<br/>
                    They then use the two 2s to activate Wrathful Devotion (which requires any double), leaving the following dice: 1, 2, 3, 4.<br/>
                    However, now that they have activated two Blessings of Khorne, they cannot activate any more and the remaining dice are discarded.

                     Some models have 'Deadly Demise x' listed in their abilities. When such a model is destroyed, roll one D6 before removing it from play (if such a model is a TRANSPORT, roll before any embarked models disembark). On a 6, each unit within 6" of that model suffers a number of mortal wounds denoted by 'x' (if this is a random number, roll separately for each unit within 6").

                     During the Declare Battle Formations step, if every model in a unit has this ability, you can set it up in Reserves instead of setting it up on the battlefield. If you do, in the Reinforcements step of one of your Movement phases you can set up this unit anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy models.

                     Weapons with [EXTRA ATTACKS] in their profile are known as Extra Attacks weapons. Each time the bearer of such a weapon fights, it can make attacks with that weapon in addition to the one it chooses to fight with. The number of attacks made with an Extra Attacks weapon cannot be modified by other rules.

Each time a model with this ability suffers damage and so would lose a wound (including wounds lost due to mortal wounds), roll one D6: if the result is greater than or equal to the number denoted by 'x: that wound is ignored and is not lost. If a model has more than one Feel No Pain ability, you can only use one of those abilities each time that model<br/>

                     Weapons with [HAZARDOUS] in their profile are known as Hazardous weapons. Each time a unit is selected to shoot or fight, if one or more models attack with Hazardous weapons, then after that unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must take one Hazardous test for each Hazardous weapon that was just used by rolling one D6. For each roll of 1, that test is failed and one model in that unit equipped with a Hazardous weapon is destroyed (selected by the controlling player), unless that model is a Character, Monster or Vehicle, in which case it suffers 3 mortal wounds instead. Note that if you selected a Character model in an Attached unit, the mortal wounds suffered must be allocated to that model first, even if there is another model in that unit that has lost one or more wounds or has had attacks allocated to it this phase.

                     Weapons with [LANCE] in their profile are known as Lance weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, if the bearer made a Charge move this turn, add 1 to that attack&#8217;s Wound roll.

                    <span class="bold">Leader:</span>
                     While a Bodyguard unit contains a Leader, it is known as an Attached unit and, with the exception of rules that are triggered when units are destroyed (pg 12), it is treated as a single unit for all rules purposes. Each time an attack targets an Attached unit, until the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must use the Toughness characteristic of the Bodyguard models in that unit, even if a Leader in that unit has a different Toughness characteristic. Each time an attack sucessfully wounds an Attached unit, that attack cannot be allocated to a Character model in that unit, even if that Character model has lost one or more wounds or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase. As soon as the last Bodyguard model in an Attached unit has been destroyed, any attacks made against that unit that have yet to be allocated can then be allocated to Character models in that unit.

                    <span class="bold">Pistol:</span>
                     Weapons with [PISTOL] in their profile are known as Pistols. If a unit contains any models equipped with Pistols, that unit is eligible to shoot in its controlling player&#8217;s Shooting phase even while it is within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units. When such a unit is selected to shoot, it can only resolve attacks using its Pistols and can only target one of the enemy units it is within Engagement Range of. In such circumstances, a Pistol can target an enemy unit even if other friendly units are within Engagement Range of the same enemy unit.&#160;<br/>
                    <br/>
                    If a model is equipped with one or more Pistols, unless it is a MONSTER or VEHICLE model, it can either shoot with its Pistols or with all of its other ranged weapons. Declare whether such a model will shoot with its Pistols or its other ranged weapons before selecting targets.
