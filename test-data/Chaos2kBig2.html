                     Weapons with [ASSAULT] in their profile are known as Assault weapons. If a unit that Advanced this turn contains any models equipped with Assault weapons, it is still eligible to shoot in this turn&#8217;s Shooting phase. When such a unit is selected to shoot, you can only resolve attacks using Assault weapons its models are equipped with.

                     Some models have 'Deadly Demise x' listed in their abilities. When such a model is destroyed, roll one D6 before removing it from play (if such a model is a TRANSPORT, roll before any embarked models disembark). On a 6, each unit within 6" of that model suffers a number of mortal wounds denoted by 'x' (if this is a random number, roll separately for each unit within 6").

                    <span class="bold">Deep Strike:</span>
                     During the Declare Battle Formations step, if every model in a unit has this ability, you can set it up in Reserves instead of setting it up on the battlefield. If you do, in the Reinforcements step of one of your Movement phases you can set up this unit anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy models.

                     Weapons with [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] in their profile are known as Devastating Wounds weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, a Critical Wound inflicts a number of mortal wounds on the target equal to the Damage characteristic of that weapon and the attack sequence ends.

                     Weapons with [EXTRA ATTACKS] in their profile are known as Extra Attacks weapons. Each time the bearer of such a weapon fights, it can make attacks with that weapon in addition to the one it chooses to fight with. The number of attacks made with an Extra Attacks weapon cannot be modified by other rules.

                    <span class="bold">Feel No Pain 5+:</span>
                     Some models have 'Feel No Pain x+' listed in their abilities. Each time a model with this ability suffers damage and so would lose a wound (including wounds lost due to mortal wounds), roll one D6: if the result is greater than or equal to the number denoted by 'x: that wound is ignored and is not lost. If a model has more than one Feel No Pain ability, you can only use one of those abilities each time that model<br/>
                    suffers damage and so would lose a wound.

                     Weapons with [HAZARDOUS] in their profile are known as Hazardous weapons. Each time a unit is selected to shoot or fight, if one or more models attack with Hazardous weapons, then after that unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must take one Hazardous test for each Hazardous weapon that was just used by rolling one D6. For each roll of 1, that test is failed and one model in that unit equipped with a Hazardous weapon is destroyed (selected by the controlling player), unless that model is a Character, Monster or Vehicle, in which case it suffers 3 mortal wounds instead. Note that if you selected a Character model in an Attached unit, the mortal wounds suffered must be allocated to that model first, even if there is another model in that unit that has lost one or more wounds or has had attacks allocated to it this phase.

                     Weapons with [IGNORES COVER] in their profile are known as Ignores Cover weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, the target cannot have the Benefit of Cover against that attack.

                    <span class="bold">Lance:</span>
                     Weapons with [LANCE] in their profile are known as Lance weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, if the bearer made a Charge move this turn, add 1 to that attack&#8217;s Wound roll.

                    <span class="bold">Leader:</span>
                     While a Bodyguard unit contains a Leader, it is known as an Attached unit and, with the exception of rules that are triggered when units are destroyed (pg 12), it is treated as a single unit for all rules purposes. Each time an attack targets an Attached unit, until the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must use the Toughness characteristic of the Bodyguard models in that unit, even if a Leader in that unit has a different Toughness characteristic. Each time an attack sucessfully wounds an Attached unit, that attack cannot be allocated to a Character model in that unit, even if that Character model has lost one or more wounds or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase. As soon as the last Bodyguard model in an Attached unit has been destroyed, any attacks made against that unit that have yet to be allocated can then be allocated to Character models in that unit.

                     Weapons with [LETHAL HITS] in their profile are known as Lethal Hits weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, a Critical Hit automatically wounds the target.

                     Weapons with [PRECISION] in their profile are known as Precision weapons. Each time an attack made with such a weapon successfully wounds an Attached unit, if a Character model in that unit is visible to the attacking model, the attacking model&#8217;s player can choose to have that attack allocated to that Character model instead of following the normal attack sequence.

                    <span class="bold">Psychic:</span>
                     Some weapons and abilities can only be used by PSYKERS. Such weapons and abilities are tagged with the word 'Psychic'. If a Psychic weapon or ability causes any unit to suffer one or more wounds, each of those wounds is considered to have been inflicted by a Psychic Attack.

                     If every model in a unit has this ability, then each time a ranged attack is made against it, subtract 1 from that attack&#8217;s Hit roll.

                     Weapons with [SUSTAINED HITS X] in their profile are known as Sustained Hits weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, if a Critical Hit is rolled, that attack scores a number of additional hits on the target as denoted by &#8216;x&#8217;

                     If your Army Faction is LEGIONES DAEMONICA, certain areas of the battlefield are considered to be within your army&#8217;s Shadow of Chaos, as follows:&#160;<br/>
                    &#9632; Your deployment zone is always within your army&#8217;s Shadow of Chaos.<br/>
                    &#9632; At the start of any phase, if you control at least half of the objective markers within No Man&#8217;s Land, until the end of that phase, No Man&#8217;s Land is within your army&#8217;s Shadow of Chaos.<br/>
                    &#9632; At the start of any phase, if you control at least half of the objective markers within your opponent&#8217;s deployment zone, until the end of that phase, your opponent&#8217;s deployment zone is within your army&#8217;s Shadow of Chaos.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    DAEMONIC MANIFESTATION<br/>
                    While a Legiones Daemonica unit from your army is within your army&#8217;s Shadow of Chaos, each time that unit takes a Battle-shock test, add 1 to that test and, if that test is passed, one model in that unit regains up to D3 lost wounds (if that unit is a Battleline unit and that test is passed, up to D3 destroyed models can be returned to that unit instead).<br/>
                    <br/>
                    DAEMONIC TERROR<br/>
                    While an enemy unit is within your army&#8217;s Shadow of Chaos, each time that unit takes a Battle-shock test, subtract 1 from that test and, if that test is failed, that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.

                     Weapons with [TORRENT] in their profile are known as Torrent weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, that attack automatically hits the target.

                     Each time a LEGIONES DAEMONICA unit from your army is set up on the battlefield using the Deep Strike ability, if it is set up wholly within your army&#8217;s Shadow of Chaos, it can be set up anywhere that is more than 6" horizontally away from all enemy models, instead of more than 9".
